# OmniAutomation

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I use to
automate OmniGroup applications. Currently, these focus on OmniFocus,
as I use it daily.

## Focus

Initially, this repository will convert the suite of AppleScript-based
OmniFocus scripts that I use daily to OmniAutomation (Javascript) and
provide compatibility with OmniFocus 4.

## Inspiration

My daily AppleScripts come from a variety of sources, including:

- [curtclifton/OmniFocusScripts: Various scripts for automating
  OmniFocus](https://github.com/curtclifton/OmniFocusScripts)
- [lemonmade/templates: Templates Applescript for
  OmniFocus.](https://github.com/lemonmade/templates)
- [dbyler/omnifocus-scripts: Scripts for use with
  OmniFocus](https://github.com/dbyler/omnifocus-scripts)
- [brandonpittman/OmniFocus: Scripts for
  OmniFocus](https://github.com/brandonpittman/OmniFocus)
